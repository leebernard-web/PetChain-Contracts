## Teck Stack
* Language: Rust
* Network: Stellar

## Getting Started
Check out the [main petchain repo](https://github.com/DogStark/petChain-Frontend) to get a clear overview of the entire PetChain project—its purpose, how it works

For detailed development setup and environment configuration, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Build and Test Smart Contracts

#### Prerequisites
Install Stellar CLI:
```bash
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

#### Build the Stellar Contracts
```bash
cd stellar-contracts
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```
This compiles the Stellar smart contracts. Run this after making changes to confirm everything still compiles correctly.

#### Run Tests
```bash
cd stellar-contracts
cargo test
```
This runs the test suite for the contracts. Use it to make sure your changes don't break existing functionality.

#### Gas Optimization Benchmarks
The contract includes comprehensive gas optimization improvements. Run the gas benchmarks:
```bash
cd stellar-contracts
cargo test gas_benchmarks
```
See [GAS_OPTIMIZATION.md](stellar-contracts/GAS_OPTIMIZATION.md) for detailed performance analysis.

#### Deploy to Testnet
```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/petchain_stellar.wasm \
  --network testnet
```
